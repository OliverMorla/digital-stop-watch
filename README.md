This project allows users to easily track the time spent on a specific task or activity on the webpage. The stopwatch is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which allows for a custom design and formatting. Additionally, the project is created using only vanilla JavaScript, which means it doesn't require any external libraries or frameworks and can be easily integrated into any website.It's perfect for anyone who wants to measure elapsed time on a website, like for example for a sport website, education or any other case where tracking time is important. The stopwatch is lightweight and easy to use, making it perfect for beginners or those who want to quickly add a stopwatch to their webpage.
